Tasks
/*Create above table in database and insert the data.*/
create table STUDENT (
    Student_Name varchar2(4000) not null,
    Student_RollNo varchar2(4000) not null,
    Student_Class varchar2(4000) not null,
    Age number not null,
    Fathers_Name varchar2(4000)
);

INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('AJAY KUMAR','IETLINF01','X',16,'PREM KUMAR'); 
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('RAJAT MISHRA','IETLINF02','XI',17,'PANKAJ MISHRA');
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('SUDHEER SHARMA','IETLINF03','IX',15,'SUNDER SHARMA'); 
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('NANCY KAUR','IETLINF04','XII',18,'AK SINGH');
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('SUMITA SHARMA','IETLINF05','IV',14,'AJAY SHARMA'); 
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('NANDINI GUPTA','IETLINF06','VII',18,'RAM GUPTA') ;
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('RAM KUMAR','IETLINF07','X',16,'RAMAN KUMAR');

/*2-Write sql query to find out total number of students in each class.*/
SELECT Student_Class ,COUNT(1) as Total_Students FROM STUDENT GROUP BY Student_Class;

/*3-Write sql query to find out average age of students in each class.*/
SELECT Student_Class ,AVG(AGE) as Average_Age FROM STUDENT GROUP BY Student_Class;

/*4-Write sql query to find out the number of students having same roll no.*/
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('ABC XYZ','IETLINF07','IV',16,'RAMAN XYZ');
SELECT Student_RollNo ,count(1) as Number_Of_Students FROM STUDENT GROUP BY Student_RollNo;

/*5-Write sql query to view the duplicate name of a student from the table.*/
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES ('ABC XYZ','IETLINF06','XI',17,'RAMAN ABC');
SELECT STUDENT_NAME,COUNT(STUDENT_NAME) AS DUPLICATE_NAME_COUNT FROM STUDENT GROUP BY STUDENT_NAME HAVING COUNT(STUDENT_NAME)>1;
